## ✨ Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Higher monthly charges correlate with higher churn risk, while customers with higher total charges tend to be more loyal.
- Services such as multiple lines, lack of online backup or device protection increase churn risk.
- Demographic factors like being single or having no dependents are also associated with higher churn.

## ✅ Conclusion
By targeting customer segments identified as high-risk and offering tailored incentives or service improvements, the company can effectively reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.
